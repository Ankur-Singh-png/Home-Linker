The project aims to create a comprehensive web-based Real Estate Property Management System that enables users to list, explore, book, and review properties.
It offers advanced management tools and analytics, including user registration, property listing and booking, wishlist and cart, secure identity verification, customizable categories, reviews and ratings, and soft deletion of properties. 
The admin dashboard allows users to manage listings, categories, bookings, payments, and reviews, view analytics, and handle user queries. The system also includes a Contact Us module for visitors to submit queries directly to admins. 
The backend uses Spring Boot for JPA and REST APIs, while the frontend can integrate React for UI. The database is fully normalized using MySQL, with role-based authorization and userÂ validation.
